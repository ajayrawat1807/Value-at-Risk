# Value at Risk (VaR) – Excel Model

This repository contains an **Excel model** to calculate **Value at Risk (VaR)**, a widely used risk management tool that measures the potential loss in value of a portfolio or investment over a defined period, at a given confidence level.

## 📂 File in this Repository
- `VAR.xlsx` → Excel file for calculating Value at Risk.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the `VAR.xlsx` file from this repository.  
2. Open it in Microsoft Excel (or compatible spreadsheet software).  
3. Input your portfolio/asset returns and select:
   - Confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%)  
   - Time horizon (e.g., 1 day, 10 days)  
4. The model will compute the **VaR estimate**.

## 📊 Methods Used
This Excel model supports VaR calculation using:
- Historical Simulation  
- Variance-Covariance (Parametric) Method  
- Monte Carlo Simulation  

## 📝 Notes
- Replace the sample data with your own portfolio or stock returns.  
- Ensure macros are enabled (if applicable).  
- Results show the potential maximum loss with the chosen confidence level.
